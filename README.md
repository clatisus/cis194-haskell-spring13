# cis194-haskell-spring13

Learn Haskell by walking through the course [CIS 194 - Spring 2013](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) by Brent Yorgey, as recommended in https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell.

The solutions are all written by me, but after finished I often take a look at others' solution (listed below) to verify mine. As well as getting inspirations on alternatives.
